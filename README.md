# Brigade Knowledge Base 

The Brigade Knowledge Base Project is an effort between Code for America Staff, the National Advisory Council, and the Knowledge Brigade Action Team. The goal is to develop a platform to showcase all the lessons learned by the greater civic technology movement. We'll also include all the resources needed by Brigade core team members to run a successful civic technology community. 

We're breaking out the work into three phases. 

### Phase One: Gathering up what we have 
We'll gather up all the documents we currently have an simply drop them into organized folders. 

### Phase Two: Transition everything we have into Markdown for easy editing. 
The rationale behind this is that several of our documents are pretty old. Converting them into Markdown and placing them on GitHub will enable us to accept pull requests on documents. 

### Phase Three: Find & implement new knowledge base platform 

Ideally, we'd place our knowledge base into a platform that's easy for anyone to go in and propose an update to. It should also be easy to read and access for people new to the space. While GitHub is functional, it does take some getting used to. 

## How you can contribute 

If you have a civic tech guide or document that might be useful; feel free to drop in into one of the folders. It doesn't need to be in markdown as we can convert it later.
